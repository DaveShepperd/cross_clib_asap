# cross_clib_asap

Provides some of the functions that would otherwise be provided in libc but for the ASAP processor. See the sample application [HERE](https://github.com/daveshepperd/asap-sim.git) for an example of how it would be used.
This kit needs the toolchains in
[MACXX](https://github.com/daveshepperd/macxx.git),
[LIBR](https://github.com/daveshepperd/libr.git),
and [GCA](https://github.com/daveshepperd/macxx.git) to be built.
